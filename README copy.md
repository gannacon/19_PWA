## Description

For this assignment I was tasked with creating a fitness tracker app. I did this by creating a mongo database and mongoose schema with Express to handle the routes.

## Deployment

The app can be found at this link:
https://damp-cove-83188.herokuapp.com/?id=60f60df50b56150015cd58f3

## User Story

```md
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a screenshot of the deployed application.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

- Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

- Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

- View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

- View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
```
